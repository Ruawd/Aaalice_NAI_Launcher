NAI Launcher is a third-party client for NovelAI built with Flutter. It integrates image generation, image-to-image, inpainting, Vibe / Precise Reference, local gallery, online gallery, generation queues, Krita integration, and statistical tools into a single application, making it ideal for daily generation, batch processing, and long-term management of local artwork.

## ✨ Features Overview

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🎨 Image Generation | Supports NovelAI Diffusion V1/V2/V3/V4/V4.5/V5, Furry series, common samplers, size presets, multi-character parameters, and Anlas estimation. |
| 🖼️ Image-to-Image & Editing | Supports img2img, inpainting, Focused Inpaint, Outpaint, virtual canvas expansion, hard-edge masks, and click-to-fill region selection. |
| 🌈 Reference & Style | Supports Vibe Transfer, Precise Reference, multi-image references, Vibe pack import/export, and PNG metadata embedding/export. |
| ✍️ Prompt Tools | Includes the complete offline merged Danbooru/e621 tag and alias catalog plus Danbooru co-occurrence recommendations. Press `Ctrl/⌘+Shift+Space` for tags related to the tag before the cursor, pin the source tag for continuous insertion, and optionally merge Danbooru online relations, Chinese translations, and AI translations for missing entries. Also includes NAI/SD weight syntax assistance, token counting, in-box prompt search, and pinned words. |
| 📚 Local Gallery | Supports recursive scanning, SQLite full-text search, categories/collections/favorites, metadata parsing, batch operations, and large image previews. |
| 🌐 Online Gallery | Supports Danbooru / Safebooru / Gelbooru / AI TAG search, native rankings, multi-image details, metadata reuse, and batch downloads. |
| 📦 Generation Queue | Supports task sorting, batch generation, pause/resume, failure handling strategies, progress statistics, and queue import/export. |
| 🔌 External Integration | Supports local Krita integration, local ComfyUI workflows, system proxy, cross-platform image copying, and file location. |

In addition to the official NovelAI service, the login screen supports configurable NovelAI-compatible third-party providers. Main and image API URLs can be set separately, while `/user/subscription` validation and streaming can be disabled for generation-only gateways. A dedicated Sugar Cloud preset accepts `https://std.loliyc.com/novelai`, AstrBot's usual `/api/generate` URL, and the same token, then automatically uses the non-stream endpoint and resolves the final image URL.

### Online Gallery Sources

- **Danbooru / Safebooru**: Support tag and date searches plus native daily, weekly, and monthly rankings for a selected date. Danbooru supports login and writable favorites; Safebooru uses anonymous, read-only access to `safebooru.donmai.us`.
- **Gelbooru**: Supports public search. Optional API credentials accelerate searches and enable read-only website favorites; no synthetic local ranking is presented.
- **AI TAG**: Supports combined work/author/title/tag/model queries and verbatim Prompt syntax searches such as `::artist:`, with time ranges loaded from the live source configuration. Native live monthly, historical monthly, and older archives are available. Multi-image details support navigation, prefetching, and per-image NAI / Stable Diffusion / ComfyUI metadata reuse, plus current-image and whole-work downloads. AI TAG requires no account and is read-only.

## 📦 Download & Install

Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/Ruawd/Aaalice_NAI_Launcher/releases). The app persistently surfaces available updates before and after login and fully renders the GitHub Flavored Markdown under the Release’s “What’s Changed” section, including headings, lists, tables, quotes, code, links, and images, without repeating platform downloads or file verification details.

| Platform | Download File | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `NAI_Launcher_Windows_<version>_Setup.exe` | Installer version, recommended for general users. Supports resumable in-app downloads, verification, automatic installation, and restart. Manual setup also detects and closes an older version still running in the tray. |
| Windows | `NAI_Launcher_Windows_<version>_Portable.zip` | Portable version. In-app updates stage the new version, preserve user files, atomically swap directories, and automatically roll back and restart the previous version on failure. |
| macOS | `NAI_Launcher_macOS_<version>_Portable.zip` | Portable version. Extract and open `Aaalice NAI Launcher.app`. If an unnotarized build is blocked, you can allow it to open in System Settings > Privacy & Security. |

You can log in using NovelAI account credentials, an API Token, or a NovelAI-compatible third-party provider. Account data is stored locally on the device only, with sensitive values kept in system secure storage, including the iOS Keychain.

### Autocomplete Data & Privacy

- The base Danbooru tag and alias catalog ships with the app and is queried locally without a network connection.
- The Simplified Chinese translation dictionary is optional. It is downloaded directly from the [ffdkj/ComfyUI_Danbooru_Tag_Assistant](https://github.com/ffdkj/ComfyUI_Danbooru_Tag_Assistant) upstream only after user confirmation; this project does not redistribute that database.
- The Danbooru online supplement is enabled by default. It sends only the current English token under the cursor, never the complete prompt; it can be disabled and its cache cleared separately under Settings → Data Sources & Cache.
- AI translation for missing entries is disabled by default. When enabled, it reuses the Prompt Assistant `Translate` route and sends at most 8 untranslated tags to the model service selected by the user, which may incur API charges. Its cache can be cleared separately.
